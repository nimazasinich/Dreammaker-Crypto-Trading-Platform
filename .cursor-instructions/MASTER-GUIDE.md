## 🎯 YOUR MISSION

You are implementing a 4-phase architecture reorganization project. Everything you need is in this folder.

---

## 📖 HOW TO PROCEED - STRICT SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: READ FILES IN THIS EXACT ORDER

1. **First**, read this file (`MASTER-GUIDE.md`) completely - you're doing it now ✓
2. **Second**, read `PHASE-SEQUENCE.md` to understand the execution order
3. **Third**, read `IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md` for step-by-step instructions
4. **Fourth**, start implementing Phase 1 (and ONLY Phase 1)

### STEP 2: EXECUTION RULES

**RULE #1: SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION**
- Execute phases in strict order: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
- DO NOT start Phase 2 until Phase 1 is 100% complete and tested
- DO NOT start Phase 3 until Phase 2 is 100% complete and tested
- DO NOT start Phase 4 until Phase 3 is 100% complete and tested

**RULE #2: READ BEFORE DOING**
- Before starting each phase, re-read the relevant section in `IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md`
- Understand what you're merging and why
- Know where templates are located

**RULE #3: ASK FOR CONFIRMATION**
- After completing each phase, ask the user: "Phase X complete. Ready to proceed to Phase Y?"
- Wait for user confirmation before moving to next phase
- Show what was completed and what's next

**RULE #4: NO DELETION**
- DO NOT delete old files
- DO NOT remove old routes completely
- Keep everything until user explicitly confirms deletion
- Use redirects for backward compatibility

## 📂 WHAT YOU'LL FIND IN OTHER FILES

### In `PHASE-SEQUENCE.md`:
- Overview of all 4 phases
- Priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM)
- Time estimates
- Success criteria for each phase
- Dependencies between phases

### In `IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md`:
- Detailed step-by-step instructions for each phase
- Code templates locations
- Files to create
- Files to modify
- Testing checklists

## 🚀 YOUR STARTING POINT

After reading all three files in this folder, your FIRST action should be:

```
I have read and understood:
1. MASTER-GUIDE.md ✓
2. PHASE-SEQUENCE.md ✓
3. IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md ✓

I am ready to begin Phase 1: Unified Trading Hub.

Phase 1 will:
- Merge 6 pages into 1 unified page
- Create src/views/trading-hub/ directory structure
- Implement 5 tabs: Charts, Spot, Futures, Positions, Portfolio
- Add route redirects for backward compatibility
- Update navigation menu

Should I proceed with Phase 1?
```

**WAIT for user confirmation before starting any implementation.**

---

## 🎯 PHASE CHECKPOINTS

After completing each phase, report back using this format:

```
✅ PHASE [N] COMPLETED

What was done:
- [List completed tasks]
- [List created files]
- [List modified files]

What's next:
- Phase [N+1]: [Name]
- Estimated time: [X weeks]
- Key tasks: [Brief summary]

Ready to proceed with Phase [N+1]?
```

---

## 🔍 FINDING INFORMATION

**If you need to know "what to do":**
→ Check `IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md` under the relevant phase section

**If you need to know "in what order":**
→ Check `PHASE-SEQUENCE.md`

**If you need to know "the big picture":**
→ Re-read this file (`MASTER-GUIDE.md`)

**If something is unclear:**
→ Ask the user for clarification BEFORE proceeding

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **READ ALL THREE FILES** before writing any code
2. **EXECUTE IN SEQUENCE** - no jumping between phases
3. **ASK FOR CONFIRMATION** after each phase
4. **KEEP OLD FILES** - no deletion without permission
5. **TEST THOROUGHLY** - each phase must work before moving on

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

You'll know you're doing it right when:

✓ You read all instruction files first
✓ You ask for permission before starting each phase
✓ You complete phases in strict order (1→2→3→4)
✓ You report progress after each phase
✓ You don't delete any old files
✓ You ask questions when something is unclear

---

## 🎬 NEXT ACTION

Your next action is:

**"I will now read `PHASE-SEQUENCE.md` to understand the execution order."**

Then read `IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md`.

Then come back and say: **"Ready to begin Phase 1. Awaiting user confirmation."**

---

## 💡 REMEMBER

You are an AI agent helping to reorganize a complex codebase. The success of this project depends on:
- Following instructions precisely
- Working sequentially through phases
- Asking for confirmation at checkpoints
- Not making assumptions
- Keeping the user informed

**The files in this folder contain everything you need. Trust the process.**
