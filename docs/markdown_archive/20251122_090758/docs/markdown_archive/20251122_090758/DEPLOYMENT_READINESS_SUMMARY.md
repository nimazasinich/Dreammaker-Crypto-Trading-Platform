## Deployment Paths

### Staging Deployment

**Purpose**: Pre-production testing with real data sources but testnet exchanges

**Steps**:
1. Use `env.staging` configuration
2. Build Docker images: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`
3. Deploy to staging server
4. Run smoke tests (short suite minimum)
5. Monitor for 15+ minutes
6. Approve for production if stable

**Timeline**: 30-60 minutes including testing

---

### Production Deployment

**Purpose**: Live deployment with mainnet exchanges and real trading

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Staging deployment successful
- ✅ All smoke tests passed
- ✅ CI pipeline green
- ✅ Secrets configured securely

**Steps**:
1. Use `env.production` configuration
2. Inject production secrets (vault/secrets manager)
3. Build Docker images: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`
4. Tag images with version
5. Deploy to production server
6. Run smoke tests (short suite minimum, extended recommended)
7. Monitor continuously for first hour
8. Document deployment in release notes

**Timeline**: 45-90 minutes including testing and monitoring

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

**Configuration Changes Only**:
- No code logic changes
- No database schema changes
- No API contract changes
- No dependency updates

**Isolated Components**:
- Docker configs are independent
- CI pipeline runs separately
- Environment files are additive (existing profiles unchanged)

**Rollback Safety**:
- Previous images can be tagged and reused
- Docker Compose down/up is fast
- Data volumes persist across deployments

### Mitigations in Place ✅

- Comprehensive deployment checklist
- Automated CI validation
- Health checks on all services
- Smoke test plans
- Documented rollback procedures
- Secrets not committed to Git

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Manual Deployment**: No automated CD yet (by design for safety)
2. **Single-Server Setup**: No multi-server/load balancing config provided
3. **Basic Monitoring**: Metrics exposed but no dashboards included
4. **Manual Secrets**: Secrets must be injected manually (no auto-rotation)

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Automated CD**: Deploy to staging on main branch merge
2. **Multi-Region**: Configuration for multiple regions/availability zones
3. **Observability Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki integration
4. **Secrets Rotation**: Automated secret rotation with vault
5. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy
6. **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance regression tests
