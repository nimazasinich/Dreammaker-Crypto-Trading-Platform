2. **Scripts**: Added npm scripts for new profiles
3. **Containers**: Created optimized Dockerfiles
4. **CI/CD**: Added GitHub Actions workflow
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment guides

### Unchanged ✅

1. **Core Logic**: All trading, risk, and exchange code untouched

---

## Deployment Readiness Status

### ✅ Ready for Staging

**Prerequisites Met**:
- [x] Environment profiles configured
- [x] Docker containers defined
- [x] CI pipeline operational
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Deployment checklist available

**Next Steps**:
1. Configure staging secrets (HF_TOKEN, KuCoin testnet credentials)
2. Build Docker images: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`
3. Deploy to staging server
4. Run smoke tests (minimum: short suite)
5. Monitor for 15+ minutes

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

### ✅ Ready for Production (After Staging Validation)

**Prerequisites**:
- [x] All staging prerequisites ✅
- [ ] Staging deployment successful and stable
- [ ] All smoke tests passed in staging
- [ ] Production secrets configured securely
- [ ] Production infrastructure provisioned

**Next Steps**:
1. Validate staging results
2. Configure production secrets (mainnet credentials)
3. Build and tag production images
4. Deploy to production server
5. Run extended smoke tests
6. Monitor continuously for first hour

**Estimated Time**: 45-90 minutes

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

**Why This Is Low Risk**:
1. **Configuration Only**: No code logic changes
2. **Additive Changes**: New files added, existing files mostly unchanged
3. **Isolated Infrastructure**: Docker and CI are independent of runtime code
4. **Backward Compatible**: All existing scripts still work
5. **Tested Approach**: Using industry-standard tools (Docker, GitHub Actions)

### Rollback Plan ✅

If issues arise:
1. **Git Revert**: Simple `git revert` of this commit
2. **Docker Rollback**: Tag and revert to previous images
3. **Quick Recovery**: No database migrations or schema changes
4. **Data Preservation**: Volumes persist across deployments

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Deployment**: No automated CD to production (by design)
2. **Single Server**: No load balancing or multi-region setup
3. **Basic Monitoring**: Metrics exposed but no dashboards
4. **Secret Management**: Manual secret injection required

These are intentional trade-offs for minimal, focused deployment infrastructure.

## Next Steps for User

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Changes**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff HEAD~1
   ```

2. **Test Staging Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:staging
   ```

3. **Test Production Config Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:prod
   ```

4. **Build Docker Images**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
   ```

5. **Test Docker Stack Locally**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/health
   curl http://localhost/health
   ```

### Before Deploying to Staging

1. **Review Documentation**:
