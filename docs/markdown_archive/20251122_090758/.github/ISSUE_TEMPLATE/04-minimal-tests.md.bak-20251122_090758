## Goal
Lock in critical risk and execution behavior with a very small but high-leverage test set.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `src/services/__tests__/RiskGuard.test.ts`
  - [ ] Passing case: trade within position size & limits → `allowed: true`
  - [ ] Failing case: trade exceeding max position size → `allowed: false`
- [ ] Create `src/services/__tests__/TradeEngine.test.ts`
  - [ ] OFF mode: `executeSignal` must NOT call ExchangeClient; trade is blocked.
  - [ ] TESTNET mode: `executeSignal` calls ExchangeClient; result type is propagated.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tests pass in local dev.
- CI (once added) fails if these behaviors regress.
