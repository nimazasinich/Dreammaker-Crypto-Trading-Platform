## 🚫 What's NOT in This Build

### SPOT Trading
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Reason:** Prioritizing Futures trading for initial release

**What this means:**
- No SPOT order placement
- No SPOT balance display
- No SPOT position management

**Will SPOT be added?**  
SPOT trading is planned for a future release. The architecture is prepared, but KuCoin SPOT testnet API integration is incomplete.

**Alternative:**  
Use Futures trading with 1x leverage if you want unleveraged trades (this effectively mimics SPOT behavior).

## 📋 Configuration Reference

### Trading Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `OFF` | No trading (view-only) | Testing UI |
| `DRY_RUN` | Simulated trades (no API calls) | Strategy testing |
| `TESTNET` | Real KuCoin testnet API | Safe live testing |
| `LIVE` | Real production API | **NOT RECOMMENDED** yet |

{
  "features": {

    "autoTuning": false,
    "autoTrade": false,
    "manualTrade": true
  },
