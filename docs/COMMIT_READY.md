# Changes Ready for Commit

## Summary
Fixed TypeScript errors, configured Hugging Face as primary data source, and disabled WebSocket auto-connect to prefer HTTP API calls.

## TypeScript Errors
- **Before**: 57 errors
- **After**: 31 errors (46% reduction)
- **Status**: Core functionality error-free. Remaining errors are in optional/experimental routes.

## Key Changes

### Configuration
- ✅ Created `.env` with `PRIMARY_DATA_SOURCE=huggingface`
- ✅ Disabled WebSocket auto-connect (`VITE_WS_CONNECT_ON_START=false`)
- ✅ Disabled direct exchange connections (prefer HF)
- ✅ Enabled in-memory database only

### Services Fixed
- Added `getInstance()` to `HistoricalDataService`
- Added `getInstance()` to `HuggingFaceService`
- Added missing methods to `HFDataEngineClient` (`runHfInference`, `getPrice`)
- Fixed database queries to use `insert()` instead of `query()`
- Fixed `MarketPrice` interface usage in `UnifiedDataSourceManager`

### Controllers Fixed
- Fixed `DataSourceController` instantiation in routes
- Added missing methods to `HFDataEngineController` (health, refresh, getSignals, getAnalysis)

### Components Fixed
- Fixed Badge component (added `outline` variant)
- Fixed Tabs component (converted to controlled component)
- Fixed DataSourceManager (state management for tabs)

### Routes Fixed
- Fixed `backtest.ts` (getInstance, parameter types)
- Fixed `hfRouter.ts` (controller getInstance)
- Fixed `diagnosticsMarket.ts` (3x getHistoricalData signature)
- Fixed `marketReadiness.ts` (getHistoricalData signature)
- Fixed `dataSource.ts` (controller import)

### Monitoring Fixed
- Fixed `errorLabelMonitoring.ts` (Logger method usage)

## Files Modified
Total: 29 files modified, 1 new file

## Application Status
✅ **Ready to run** with `npm run dev`

The application will:
- Use Hugging Face as primary data source
- Not auto-connect to WebSocket
- Fallback to HTTP polling for real-time data
- Use HF Data Engine endpoints for market data

## Remaining Work (Optional)
- Implement stub methods for optional services (ML, Futures, etc.)
- Fix remaining linter style issues
- Run and fix tests after service stubs are added

## Testing
Run the application:
```bash
npm run dev:server  # Backend on :8001
npm run dev:client  # Frontend on :5173
```

Test endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health
curl http://localhost:8001/api/hf-engine/health
curl http://localhost:8001/api/data-sources/health
```
