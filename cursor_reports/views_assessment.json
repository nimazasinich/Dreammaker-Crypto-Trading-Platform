Critical path: Dashboard → Market Analysis → Scanner → Futures Trading → Positions → Portfolio works well. Key issues: (1) ZERO unit tests across all views - critical gap for production readiness, (2) TradingView is disabled/stub (SPOT not implemented), (3) Several views use mock or default data (RiskView, TrainingView simulation), (4) Some advanced features incomplete (StrategyBuilderView). IMMEDIATE ACTION: Add comprehensive test coverage (currently at ~0%, needs 80%+), validate all risk/analysis calculations, implement or remove disabled views. Recommended focus: Keep high-quality views (Dashboard, Scanner, FuturesTradingView, TradingHubView), improve mid-tier views (ChartingView, MarketView), and decide on low-scoring views (TradingView - remove?, StrategyBuilderView - complete or deprecate?)."
